Description: anti-virus utility for Unix - base package
 Clam AntiVirus is an anti-virus toolkit for Unix. The main purpose of
 this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment
 scanning). The package provides a flexible and scalable
 multi-threaded daemon in the clamav-daemon package, a command-line
 scanner in the clamav package, and a tool for automatic updating via
 the Internet in the clamav-freshclam package. The programs are based
 on libclamav5, which can be used by other software.
 .
 This package mainly manages the clamav system account. It is not really
 useful without the clamav package. It also handles the configuration
 for both the clamav-daemon and the clamav-milter packages.

Description: anti-virus utility for Unix - command-line interface
 Clam AntiVirus is an anti-virus toolkit for Unix. The main purpose of
 this software is the integration with mail servers (attachment
 scanning). The package provides a flexible and scalable
 multi-threaded daemon in the clamav-daemon package, a command-line
 scanner in the clamav package, and a tool for automatic updating via
 the Internet in the clamav-freshclam package. The programs are based
 on libclamav5, which can be used by other software.
 .
 This package contains the command line interface. Features:
  - built-in support for various archive formats, including Zip, Tar,
    Gzip, Bzip2, OLE2, Cabinet, CHM, BinHex, SIS and others;
  - built-in support for almost all mail file formats;
  - built-in support for ELF executables and Portable Executable files
    compressed with UPX, FSG, Petite, NsPack, wwpack32, MEW, Upack and
    obfuscated with SUE, Y0da Cryptor and others;
  - built-in support for popular document formats including Microsoft
    Office and Mac Office files, HTML, RTF and PDF.
 .
 For scanning to work, a virus database is needed. There are two options
 for getting it:
  - clamav-freshclam: updates the database from Internet. This is
    recommended with Internet access.
  - clamav-data: for users without Internet access. The package is
    not updated once installed. The clamav-getfiles package allows
    creating custom packages from an Internet-connected computer.

 recognizes and scans archives. Scanning is very fast and most of the time
 not noticeable.
