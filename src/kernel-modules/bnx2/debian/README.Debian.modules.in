Debianised BCM5700 Linux kernel module
======================================

This package includes the GPL'd driver of Broadcom for the BCM5700 chip.

There are a number of reasons why this driver is not in the mainstream kernel.
The biggest reason is coding style, since nobody really understood anything
about it. Although the code is not bad, it does not conform to the coding
style used throughout the kernel, and hence can not be included in the
mainstream source.

It supports the kernel VLAN API as well as the Broadcom-specific NICE API.

The source code reveals how to use "hardware accelerated" VLAN tagging. The
driver works with Ben Greear's VLAN patches.

Please refer to the README.support document for information on support for 
this driver.
