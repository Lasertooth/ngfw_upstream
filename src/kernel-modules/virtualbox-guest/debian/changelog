virtualbox-ose (1.5.0-dfsg2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Patrick Winnertz ]
  * Added README.Debian to virtualbox-ose in order to document that the
    configuration xml files of the machines are not compatible between
    1.4.0-svn4130 and the 1.5.0 release. (Closes: #441634)
  * Build only binary-dep packages in binary-dep target and only binary-indep
    packages in binary-indep target.
  * Added postrm to virtualbox-ose in order to remove the vboxusers group on
    purge. (Closes: #442396)

  [ Michael Meskes ]
  * Force udev to reload the rules in postinst. Hopefully this makes sure that
    the device always belongs to the right group.

virtualbox-ose (1.4.0svn4130-dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Patrick Winnertz ]
  * Rename virtualbox to virtualbox-ose since innotek has a trademark on this

  [ Daniel Baumann ]
  * Initial release (Closes: #406992, #407001, #409711).

  * Build target for module is now all instead of module
  * Build against correct kernel source
  * Integrated changes by Patrick Winnertz
  * clean: rm env.sh AutoConfig.kmk configure.log

  * Disabled stripping for VMM because it breaks VirtualBox

    See dfsg-free section in debian/rules for details.

    Therefore I removed the patch, too.
  * Don't call dh_installdeb twice.  (build-dep & build-indep)
  * Added section to create dfsg tarball automatically to debian/rules (experimental!!)
  * Added lintian.overrides for -fPIC since somehow virtualbox doesn't work with
